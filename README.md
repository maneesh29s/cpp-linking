# CPP Compilation and Linking

This repo contains all the C++ files along with a [examples.sh](./examples.sh) bash script containing different compilation commands.

This repo is helper for the article present [here](https://maneesh29s.github.io/quartz/CPP/static_vs_dynamic_linking)

Go through [examples.sh](./examples.sh) and play with different options of gcc/llvm compiler to understand in detail.
